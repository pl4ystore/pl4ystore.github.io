<h1>REDIRECTING TO SM64-JS IN 10 SECONDS</h1>
<h1>REPL Shutdown (IM BANNED FROM SOCIAL FEATURES IN REPLIT SO DO NOT EXPECT A RESPONSE ON YOUR COMMENT, CONTACT ME VIA TWITTER OR DISCORD)</h1>
<h3>Sad to announce this but, this REPL will no longer be updated due to multiple warnings on copyright infringement. This REPL is one of the most popular trending REPLs on the site and very sad to see this go so early. Thanks for your support.</h3>
<h2>BUT THE FUN ISN'T OVER YET!</h2>
<h3>The GitHub Repo is now released for everyone to continue playing without any issues so click the Mario below to build a SM64-JS Website. Thanks everyone.</h3>
